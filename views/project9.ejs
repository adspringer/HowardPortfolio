        <h4>
        Pricing Table Design
        </h4>
        <p>
I was in charge of adding the company's pricing to the website. I had to display the different pricing options customers could pick and show the benefits  for upgrading plans. I wanted this to be an engaging and useful experience for the user as well, not just to display information. The user could go straight to ordering the plan they wanted from the table and could click the check marks to go into more details about that specific aspect of the plan. 
            </p>
            <p>
I conducted competitive analysis to see some ways to display all the information I needed, then once designed I tested it using a heat map program to make sure the design was working.

        Checkout Redesign
        </h4>
        <p>
The company expanded their monitoring plans available to users so an update to the checkout flow needed to reflect the change. 
I came up with several designs to signify the different plans and how to best display the options. We ran AB testing on the two designs.

   Lead Form Design
        </h4>
        <p>
In order to drive more leads to the sales team I created a lead form for users to fill out right on the website. That way our team could call potential customers and help them build a system that was best for their home. 
The key to this design was to get the information needed without making the user go through a lot of steps.

      <li><span>There are some great aspects we would like to mimic for our site that we found on other sites,
      The use of a carousel on the home page displaying images and linking to the blog posts for upcoming games tournaments and results and posts about past games. </span></li>
      <li><span>
      In terms of layout we got some great ideas for using imagery in the background and incorporating team photos in the site to show off the brand. </span></li>
       <li><span>
      We got some great examples of how to implement social media (like Twitter) onto the website so people can read the latest tweets as well as post from the site. UCSB had a great widget for this.</span></li>
      <li><span>
      To display a schedule for the season Cal Poly had a great calendar feature that we would like to incorporate into the site. 
      UCLA had a great recap carousel that displayed results and linked to the recap of the game.  </span></li>

     <h4>
Product
     </h4>
        <p>
For our final product we made some major design changes that we felt helped our site have more of a modern and open look and feel. We took out having an image as the background and made it a solid color instead. We also went away from the more boxed sectioned layout and tried to open up the site by not having all the content being separated by boxes.  Along with layout we also tried to incorporate and keep the color variability minimal and more focused on the teamâ€™s color- blue, gold, and white.  The final product satisfied our customer and gave her the rich imagery, friendly personality, and modern look she was looking to display.
