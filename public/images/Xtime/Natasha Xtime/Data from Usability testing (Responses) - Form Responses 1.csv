","It was fairly easy and straightforward, had to figure out a few thingsÂ ",Yes,Yes,"No, would call because its more personal and convenient. I know sometimes there are times available that aren't provided online. can call using car's bluetooth. ","Hit the back button on phone and had to start all over. no data was saved 
people instinctively hit back button to go to previous page, was annoying that it did that. ","Thought the calendar feature was odd
wasn't sure how to use it at first, couldn't read it, wasn't sure what the lines meant on it. 

didn't understand the drop down for time selections. hard to read the view all time options. was confused on why there was the three set time options already

scrolled down to the bottom and expanded the last days view all time options to try to get to next weeks available times and days. said that in prior experiences that is how it works, can scroll to future dates. The calendar feature, all the way at the top was not an ideal placement and configuration to easily change what week you were on.... all the way at the bottom, realize its the wrong date and need to change it there is no easy way to change, have to scroll all the way back up and use the calendar. 

pressed the button on the calendar to change week 
saw the calendar but scrolled down to the bottom of the page to select the day.

Was overwhelmed with the options on 1st step. 
didnt notice the mileage at the top of the page at first. eventually figures it out. clicks through, didn't type in the mileage before. 

the first step was all click through, got his thinking to just click through since using mobile more for speed
gets the feeling that as soon as the next button is illuminated to move on. 

when selecting the service, was confused and selected multiple things, and one of everything- too much booking? "
